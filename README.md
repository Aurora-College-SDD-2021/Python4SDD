# Python4SDD
Python course for NSW Stage 6 Software Design and Development

## What this course isn't
This course is **not** primarily an *Introduction to Python*. Rather, it is designed around the NSW Software Design and Development curriculum and we will be as faithful as we can to the concepts of introduced in that course. As a result we will often do things that are so 'unpythonic' that they will make 'pythonistas' cringe. Python is a beautiful language with a lovely syntax and some fantastic features which we will often trash. We will at times discuss the the pythonic alternatives, but only briefly, and you will be encouraged to write your code the 'SDD' way. This approach should give you a broad understanding of software development concepts that are common to most languages and also prepare you for your assessment, particularly the dreaded HSC exam. But once this is over, do yourselves a favour, and learn to write pythonic code and appreciate its beauty.
