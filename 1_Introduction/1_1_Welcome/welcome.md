# Welcome
For this first task you should simply replace the words `look at me I am coding` with your own message to let the world know you are now an apprentice code monkey. If you see an error message, the most likely mistake is that you haven't surrounded your message with quotation marks (more on this soon)

If you just get the <span style="color:red">Incorrect</span> message without the AssertionError hint then it is
likely you have really mucked up the code. If it all seems hopeless just delete all your code and copy the code below
back into task.py and try again.

""" your first python program.
Replace the words 'look at me I am coding' with your own message to let the world know you are now coding.
"""


def print_message():
    print('look at me I am coding')


if __name__ == "__main__":
    print_message()

~~~~

Once you have checked your code, run it by right clicking on task.py and choosing "Run" from the drop-down menu 
(or you can just press Ctrl+Shift+F10)
